<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Welcome to my internet domain <b>watahsiwa.soy</b>. Je suis, je suis. I am, I am, if I am anything. I am ... want to create, code, teach, and share. I am a big fan of Linux, Vim, Bash, Chromebook, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Python, Dart/Flutter, and lately, Svelte-Sapper.</p>

<p>If you read on, something might catch your fancy. Feel free to get in touch with me by email at <b><a href="mailto:cheftech@watashiwa.soy?subject=Hello!">Watashiwa Soy Chef Tech</a></b>.  If you'd like my WebID for Socially Linked Data, you can try using <b>https://cheftech.solid.mypod.dev/profile/card#me</b>.</p>

<p>My birth name is Christopher Patrouch. I'm partial to my unofficial married last name, Patraldo (a combination of our two last names). As for my reconfigured first name and middle initial... I become a naturalized Canadian citizen in the Province of Qu√©bec (note the accent aigu). If I introduce myself as "Christophe" it fast-tracks the conversation to French. If I separate and capitalize the "R", I arrive at Christophe R Patraldo -- a nom-de-plume for the internet age, one that reflects and honors two important life achievements: marriage and naturalized citizenship.</p>

<p>I am technically a native New Yorker. Born in Manhattan, I was a toddler when my family moved from Inwood to Blauvelt in Rockland County. Go Tappan Zee High! I immediately went on to college: freshman year in Plattsburgh, sophomore year in Paris at the Sorbonne, Tsukuba Daigaku in Japan and then to SUNY Binghamton from which I graduated with a B.A. degree in French literature. Allez Stendhal!</p>

<p>French lit degree in hand, after college I worked first as a busboy, then as a waiter in a famous French restaurant named Maison Robert on School Street in the Old City Hall building (Second Empire) in Downtown Boston. I got a summer job as a lifeguard/swim instructor and language teacher in Montagnola/Lugano at the American School in Switzerland (TASIS). I spent the briefest of time as a ski bum in Aspen, Colorado -- just enough time to learn that I should go back to school after passing by Morrocco and the Peace Corps.<p>

<p>In due course, I graduated from a dual-degree program with a Master of Public Health (MPH) and a Master of Science in Urban Planning (MSUP) from Columbia University in the City of New York. I was awarded a Graduate Research Assistantships in the Center for Population and Family Health. It came with an office, a stipend and best of all free tuition.

<p>Graduate degrees in hand, I went to work as a city planning in the Department of City Planning, Bronx office in New York City. I relocated from NYC on bicycle and pedaled 3,600 miles across country to Los Angeles. I worked as a transportation planner for the cities of West Hollywood, Glendale and Santa Monica. I started a school -- the Institute of Gay and Lesbian Education; I opened a bookstore, Urban Inversion, I taught English as a Second Language, I learned to SCUBA dive, I raised two adorable Jack Russels. I may be forgetting something... oh yeah, I met my future husband. I learned Spanish. I left Los Angeles.</p>

  <p>You might be curious about the traits that I like in others (and which characterize me -- or which I, hopefully, exhibit myself):</p> 
<ul>
<li>Indepence/Freedom
 - most especially of thought and ideas, a liberated mind is hard thing to find ... but they're out there (unless this really is all just a simulation, hmmmm);</li>
<li>Integrity
- coherence (see below, Reason);</li>
<li>Reason
- logic; self-doubt & criticism, the ability to discern a method to one's madness (unless one's truly mad, of course);</li>
<li>Empathy
- caring and compassion (especially if balances and otherwise strong propensity for disdain and cynicism). Essentially, I believe in the Golden Rule -- Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.</li>
<li>Magnanimity - generosity of spirit and the capacity to forgive. One of my favorite life lessons was when a colleague told me "he did you a favor".  If I were an old-testament scholar, I might use the word "merciful" (not to be confused with it's opposite, "indifference" or "commupence".)
